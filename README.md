# Just my first vanilla Spring demo app :grinning:

Just add the Spring framework dependencies to the class build path, and you are ready to go!  

## Project resume

It's about a journey discovering Spring framework.

## In this branch

I walk trough the process of understand how Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) works.

## Future distributable features, yeah!

Branch by branch, every Spring feature will be discovered. So, if you want more Spring code, you need to checkout other branches.
